# League-of-Legends-API-scripts  
Note: requires a valid Riot API key. Go to https://developer.riotgames.com/ to get one.  
Half baked project for self-learning where the initial purpose was to improve my PHP knowledge and get an introduction to cURL. 
The scripts write the data to a json file.  
In order to obtain a match history from the API you must have both a summoner_ID and summoner_PUUID.
Run the scripts in this order:  
1. fetch_summonerID  
2. fetch_summoner_PUUID  
3. fetch_summoner_Match_History  


# todo  
Do something with the data collected
